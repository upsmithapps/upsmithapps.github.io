This cookie policy provides you with information about the cookies we use and the purposes for using them in our websites and software applications.

**What are cookies and why are cookies used:** Cookies are small text files containing a unique string of characters that are stored in your web browser’s memory when you visit a website. When you return to a website that has placed a cookie in your browser, the cookie allows a website provider to recognize that you have visited the site before.

While cookies are often only used to measure website usage (such as number of visitors and duration of visit) and effectiveness (such as topics visitors are most interested in) and to allow for ease of navigation or use and, as such, are not associated with any Personal Information, they are also used at times to personalize a known visitor's experience of a website by being associated with profile information or user preferences. Over time this information provides valuable insight to help improve the user experience.

**How we use Cookies:**  We use cookies and related technologies (“Cookies”) to provide services, gather information when users navigate through the site to enhance and personalize the experience, to understand usage patterns, and to improve our sites, products, and services.

Cookies in each of the categories below may be session or persistent cookies. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear when you close your browser, restart, or turn off your device. Persistent cookies remain on your device after you close your browser, restart, or turn off your device.

Cookies on our sites are generally divided into the following categories:

- Strictly *Necessary Cookies:*  These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.
- Functional and Performance Cookies. These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization or allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous.  These cookies may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages.  If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly. Additionally, if you do not allow these cookies we may not be able to monitor the performance of our website.

**How to Control Cookies**:  You can review your Internet browser settings, typically under the sections "Help" or "Internet Options," to exercise choices you have for certain Cookies. If you choose to block all cookies, our services will not function as intended. If you have blocked all cookies and wish to make full use of the features and services we offer, we recommend enabling at least first-party cookies. Rather than blocking all cookies, you can choose to block only third-party cookies.
